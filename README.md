### Manual Adding of a Deadline

If you found new information online, you can manually add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
- Optionally add `hindex` (refers to h5-index from [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng))
- Example:
    ```yaml
    - title: BestConf
      year: 2022
      id: bestconf22  # title as lower case + last two digits of year
      full_name: Best Conference for Anything  # full conference name
      link: link-to-website.com
      deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
      abstract_deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
      timezone: Asia/Seoul
      place: Incheon, South Korea
      date: September, 18-22, 2022
      start: YYYY-MM-DD
      end: YYYY-MM-DD
      paperslink: link-to-full-paper-list.com
      pwclink: link-to-papers-with-code.com
      hindex: 100.0
      sub: SP
      note: Important
    ```

    ```
  - Running

    docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source=${PWD},target=/app deadlines
    ```
